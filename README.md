# Project: Flappy Bird AI using Pygame and NEAT
## Introduction
This project aims to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that can play the popular game Flappy Bird using the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. The game is developed using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development.
## NEAT Algorithm
NEAT is a machine learning algorithm that uses a genetic algorithm to evolve artificial neural networks. It is based on three key techniques: tracking genes with history markers to allow crossover among topologies, applying speciation (the evolution of species) to preserve innovations, and developing topologies incrementally from simple initial structures ("complexifying").
## Game Development
The game is developed using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development. The player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The AI agent is trained to play the game using the NEAT algorithm.
## Training Strategy
The training strategy proposed in involves developing an AI agent that can learn to play Flappy Bird using the NEAT algorithm. The agent is trained using a fitness function that rewards the agent for staying alive and penalizes it for colliding with the pipes. The NEAT algorithm is used to evolve the neural network that controls the bird's movement.

To create a Flappy Bird game with an AI agent using Pygame and NEAT, you can follow these steps:
1. Install Pygame and NEAT modules in Python.
2. Create the game environment using Pygame, including the bird, pipes, and background.
3. Implement the game logic, including the bird's movement and collision detection.
4. Train the AI agent using the NEAT algorithm, using a fitness function that rewards the agent for staying alive and penalizes it for colliding with the pipes.
5. Evolve the neural network that controls the bird's movement using the NEAT algorithm.
6. Test the AI agent's performance in the game environment.
